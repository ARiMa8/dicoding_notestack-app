# üìù NoteStack: A Modern React Notes App

## This application is a final project developed for the "Belajar Fundamental Aplikasi Web dengan React" course at Dicoding Academy. It provides a functional and responsive interface for managing your notes.

## ‚ú® Key Features
- Full RESTful API Integration: The app interacts with a public API to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on notes. All notes are persisted on a remote server.
- User Authentication: Includes a complete user flow with registration and login pages to manage notes securely.
- Component-Based Architecture: The user interface is built with reusable React components, ensuring the code is structured, modular, and easy to maintain.
- Responsive Layout: The design utilizes CSS to display notes dynamically across various screen sizes, from desktops to mobile devices.
- Loading Indicators & Feedback: The app provides clear visual feedback through a loading indicator when data is being fetched from the API. It also displays error messages for failed operations.
- Theming & Localization: Users can toggle between light and dark themes and switch the application language between English and Indonesian.
